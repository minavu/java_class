This program is a small device application for an airline project.
Users can create a new flight for a new or existing airline.
Users can create multiple airlines with all different flights.
Users can search an airline for flights or display all flights.
Users can display a helpful README file that describes what this
program is and how to use it.  Usage should be intuitive to anyone
familiar with the airline project for this course.  Error handling
will be seen in small pop ups at the bottom of the screen in case
where users enter bad data to create a flight.  It was a wonderful
learning experience albeit a bit rushed for a busy college student.
Poke around the app to see some interesting features.  It may look
small, but every feature required a lot of research and creativity!
This program was built with Android Studio.
